BuilderTag Minetest mod

This mod was made for minetest servers. For "Builders" (professional builders)
to have their unique tag to show how important it is to the server architecture.

But to put it on your server, you have to be aware that you are giving a unique tag to the right person. 
(Only if your server has a "Builder" like a VIP)
