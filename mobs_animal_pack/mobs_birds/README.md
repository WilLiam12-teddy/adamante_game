# mobs_birds
(from blert2112's mobs_sky)

This (poikilos) fork is a radical graphical overhaul, so no media (other
than the model, which is modified) is included.

## Developer Notes
* mobs_birds_thrush.b3d by poikilos: Some thrushes have a similar body
  type to the "Lovely Cotinga," so I made the proportions an average of
  several thrushes to work with exotic bird texture(s) while also making
  the model more universal.
