  The distributor of the original mobs_sky modpack implicitly permits
  explicitly encourages anyone to redistribute (see

Further evidence of author's intent: by including a license file in each
mod that doesn't mention any boundaries (other than CC licenses which
have been retained here) in a public repository, the original author(s)
indicate(s) that the code and media are publicly licensed, as opposed to
not being licensed and opposed to having a limited license.
